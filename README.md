* approving new projects within the scope for CNCF set by the Governing Board, and create a conceptual architecture for the projects,aligning projects, removing or archiving projects,
* accepting feedback from end user committee and map to projects,
* aligning interfaces to components under management (code reference implementations before standardizing), and defining common practices to be implemented across CNCF projects, if any.

## Voting

In various situations the CNCF TOC shall hold a vote. These votes can happen on the phone, email, or via a voting service, when appropriate. TOC members can either respond "agree, yes, +1", "disagree, no, -1", or "abstain". A vote passes with two-thirds vote of votes cast based on the charter (see [6(c)(viii)](https://cncf.io/governance)). An abstain vote equals not voting at all.
