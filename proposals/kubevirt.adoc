## Project name and description

"Weave Flux" (or just "Flux") is the GitOps Kubernetes Operator: it
automatically ensures that the state of a cluster matches the config
in git and images are upgraded automatically. Flux uses an operator in
the cluster to trigger deployments inside Kubernetes. It supports Helm
as well, with a subproject called the "Helm operator".

Weaveworks started the project in July 2016 and is receiving more and
more contributions from a growing community. The team of maintainers
is very active and made up from people from different companies.
