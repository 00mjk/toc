# Name of project: Container Networking Interface

# Description
The CNI (Container Network Interface) project consists of a specification and libraries for writing plugins to configure network interfaces
in Linux containers, along with a number of supported plugins. CNI concerns itself only with network connectivity of containers and removing 
allocated resources when the container is deleted. Because of this focus, CNI has a wide range of support and the specification is simple to 
implement. CNI consists of 3 separate comonents:

  *  CNI Specification: defines an straightforward API between runtimes and network plugins for container network setup/teardown.  No more, no less.
  *  Plugins: provide network setup for a variety of use-cases and serve as reference examples of plugins conforming to the CNI specification
  *  Library: provide a Go implementation of the CNI specification that runtimes can use to more easily consume CNI
     NOTE: CNI Specification is independently versioned from the CNI library and plugins in the repository (e.g. the versions of releases). The plugins are being pulled out into a separate repository
