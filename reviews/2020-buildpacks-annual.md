# 2020 Buildpacks Annual

## Requirements
* Include a link to your projectâ€™s devstats page. We will be looking for signs of consistent or increasing contribution activity. Please feel free to add commentary to add colour to the numbers and graphs we will see on devstats.
  * [CNCF DevStats](https://buildpacks.devstats.cncf.io)
  * Deliverables do not include buildpacks themselves. Instead this project is about fostering an ecosystem where individuals or companies can use the specification and tools provided by this project to create and use them.

* How many maintainers do you have, and which organisations are they from? (Feel free to link to an existing MAINTAINERS file if appropriate.)
  * There are 6 maintainers in total that work for VMware and Salesforce.

* What do you know about adoption, and how has this changed since your last review / since you joined Sandbox? If you can list companies that are end users of your project, please do so. (Feel free to link to an existing ADOPTERS file if appropriate.)
  * [ADOPTERS.md](https://github.com/buildpacks/community/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md)

* How has the project performed against its goals since the last review? (We won't penalize you if your goals changed for good reasons.)
  * This is the first time we've done a review (and we didn't state goals as part of our [Sandbox proposal](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/proposals/sandbox/buildpacks.adoc)).
  * For the first year we did have some goals in mind:
    * Grow community to include companies/users beyond Pivotal/Heroku - From the weekly working group meetings and slack we have participation from Google, Microsoft, Dokku, and Deft among others.
    * Use the Buildpacks in production - At the start of the Sandbox period we had 0 users using buildpacks in the wild, but now we have [ADOPTERS.md](https://github.com/buildpacks/community/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md).
    * 1.0 of the Specification - We didn't quite achieve this, but after getting feedback from users, we've made some breaking changes and plan to release 1.0 this year.

* What are the current goals of the project? For example, are you working on major new features? Or are you concentrating on adoption or documentation?
  * [2020 Roadmap](https://medium.com/buildpacks/cloud-native-buildpacks-2020-roadmap-b7e43876473a)
  * Maturity
    * Finish up half finished features from last year like Buildpackages
    * codify the release cadence/process across the project
    * polish up the tools as we near 1.0.
  * Based off of feedback from KubeCon NA, we want to improve our the experience after `pack` for users wanting to integrate Buildpacks in their own build pipeline.
  * Release 1.0 of the Spec
  * Continue to expand our community of user and contributors

* How can the CNCF help you achieve your upcoming goals?
  * Are there more opportunities to engage potential interested users beyond KubeCon? Sandbox projects more than any project needs help with marketing and outreach.

* Do you think that your project meets the criteria for incubation?
  * Yes, we've already [submitted a proposal](https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/338) for incubation.
