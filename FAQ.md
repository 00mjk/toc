# CNCF TOC FAQ

A FAQ geared towards CNCF TOC and project issues.

## How do I join the TOC?

The TOC is a body elected by a variety of constituents. There is a public election schedule:
https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/election-schedule.md

The best way to get involved is to start attending TOC meetings and become an official TOC Contributor:
https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md

If you have specific focus areas, CNCF SIG meetings are good opportunity to dive in:

## How do I propose my project to the CNCF?

The first step is to file a [project proposal](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/project_proposals.adoc) and request a community presentation. 

See these examples for inspiration:
* CRI-O: https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/177
* etcd: https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/143
* Falco: https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/157
* Flux: https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/232
* Harbor: https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/135
* TiKV: https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/133
* Virtual Kubelet: https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/153

## What are CNCF SIGs?

The CNCF Special Interest Groups (SIGs) scale contributions by the CNCF technical and user community, while retaining integrity and increasing quality in support of our mission.

## What type of governance is my CNCF project expected to follow?

CNCF does not require its hosted projects to follow any specific governance model by default. 

Instead, CNCF [specifies](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc) that graduated projects need to "[e]xplicitly define a project governance and committer process." 

This varied and open governance approach has led to different projects defining what is best and optimized for their community: 

* https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md
* https://github.com/coredns/coredns/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md
* https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md
* https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/governance/governance.md
* https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/governance.md
* https://prometheus.io/governance/

## Does the CNCF TOC control CNCF projects in anyway?

Neither the CNCF Governing Board (GB) nor the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) is responsible for managing CNCF-hosted projects. 

Instead, the maintainers of those projects manage them; this includes defining the governance process. The GB is responsible for the budget.

TOC members are available to provide guidance to the projects but do not control them. To date, we have had no meaningful disagreements between the TOC and project maintainers. 

Please see the [TOC Principles](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/PRINCIPLES.md) for more details.

## What type of support do I receive as a CNCF project?

The CNCF provides a variety of services that are accessible by maintainers via the ServiceDesk: https://github.com/cncf/servicedesk
