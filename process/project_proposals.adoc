== CNCF Project Proposal Process v1.2

 . *Introduction*. This governance policy sets forth the proposal process for projects to be accepted into the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (“CNCF”). The process is the same for both existing projects which seek to move into the CNCF, and new projects to be formed within the CNCF.
 . *Project Proposal Requirements*. Projects must be proposed via https://github.com/cncf/toc/tree/master/proposals[GitHub]. Project proposals submitted to the CNCF (see https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/proposals/kubernetes.adoc[example]) can be written in https://www.markdownguide.org[Markdown], http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc], or http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html[reStructuredText] and must provide the following information to the best of your ability:

 .. name of project (must be unique within CNCF)
 .. project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history)
 .. statement on alignment with CNCF charter mission
 .. sponsor from TOC (sponsor helps mentor projects)
 .. preferred maturity level (see https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc[CNCF Graduation Criteria])
 .. license (charter dictates http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0[Apache 2] by default)
 .. source control (GitHub by default)
 .. external dependencies (including licenses)
 .. initial committers (how long working on project)
 .. infrastructure requests (CI / CNCF Cluster)
 .. communication channels (slack, irc, mailing lists)
 .. issue tracker (GitHub by default)
 .. website (current version will move to project.cncf.io)
 .. release methodology and mechanics
 .. social media accounts
 .. community size and any existing sponsorship

. *Project Acceptance Process*.
 .. Projects are required to present their proposal at a TOC meeting
 .. Projects get accepted via a 2/3 supermajority vote of the TOC
